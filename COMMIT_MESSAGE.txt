WIP: Attempting to fix bash syntax errors in progress.sh

This commit contains multiple attempts to fix syntax errors preventing
Leonardo from running. The build completes but execution fails with
syntax errors.

Fixes attempted:
- Commented out problematic show_matrix_progress() function
- Escaped pipe characters in printf format strings
- Changed direct variable interpolation to %s format specifiers
- Moved utility functions to top of file (format_bytes, format_duration)
- Added fallback for systems without bc command

Current status:
- Build succeeds: bash assembly/build-simple.sh
- Execution fails: ./leonardo.sh line 3127 syntax error

See ISSUE_SYNTAX_ERRORS.md for detailed problem description and
help needed from other contributors.

Related to USB-first deployment and chat startup improvements.
