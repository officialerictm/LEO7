# Leonardo AI Universal - Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status & Vision Alignment

### Current Implementation (Bash MVP)
- **Architecture**: Modular Bash scripts with assembly system
- **UI**: Working CLI with interactive menus
- **Features**: Basic model management, USB deployment, web interface
- **Limitations**: Performance, security, enterprise features

### Original Vision Gap Analysis
| Feature | Vision | Current | Gap |
|---------|--------|---------|-----|
| Core Engine | Go-based | Bash | Need complete rewrite |
| Hardware Profiling | Adaptive AI selection | None | Major feature missing |
| Security | Zero-trace, encrypted | Basic | Critical gap |
| Deployment | Universal (USB/Cloud/Container) | USB only | Limited scope |
| Enterprise | RBAC, SSO, Fleet mgmt | None | Not started |

## ðŸ“‹ Pragmatic Development Phases

### Phase 1: Complete Bash MVP (Week 1)
**Goal**: Deliver working product that validates concept

- [ ] Fix menu navigation to actual features
- [ ] Complete model download/management flow
- [ ] Finish USB deployment with verification
- [ ] Add basic system health checks
- [ ] Create installation documentation
- [ ] Package first release (v7.0.0-beta)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 2)
**Goal**: Add critical missing features to Bash version

- [ ] Implement model selection logic
- [ ] Add offline model support
- [ ] Create update mechanism
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add progress indicators
- [ ] Create demo videos

### Phase 3: Architecture Decision (Week 3)
**Goal**: Decide on future architecture

**Option A: Evolve Bash Version**
- Pros: Faster iteration, working base
- Cons: Performance limits, harder enterprise features

**Option B: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep Bash for CLI/Assembly
- Add Go modules for performance-critical parts
- Pros: Gradual migration, maintains compatibility
- Cons: Complexity

**Option C: Full Go Rewrite**
- Pros: Matches original vision, better performance
- Cons: Longer timeline, starts from scratch

### Phase 4: Core Enhancement (Weeks 4-5)
Based on architecture decision:

**If Hybrid/Go:**
- [ ] Create Go hardware profiler
- [ ] Build model selection engine
- [ ] Implement secure storage
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

**If Bash Evolution:**
- [ ] Optimize critical paths
- [ ] Add Python helpers for complex tasks
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Create plugin system

### Phase 5: Deployment Expansion (Week 6)
- [ ] Docker container support
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Cloud deployment scripts (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- [ ] Air-gap deployment package
- [ ] Local service installation

### Phase 6: Enterprise Features (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Basic authentication
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Remote management API
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics Revised

### Short Term (4 weeks)
- âœ“ Working MVP with core features
- âœ“ 100+ GitHub stars
- âœ“ 10+ community testers
- âœ“ Documentation complete

### Medium Term (8 weeks)
- âœ“ 500+ active users
- âœ“ 3+ deployment targets working
- âœ“ Community contributions
- âœ“ First enterprise pilot

### Long Term (6 months)
- âœ“ 1000+ GitHub stars
- âœ“ Production deployments
- âœ“ Security audit passed
- âœ“ Enterprise customers

## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Today**: Fix menu integration, test all paths
2. **Tomorrow**: Complete model download flow
3. **This Week**: Release v7.0.0-beta
4. **Next Week**: Gather feedback, prioritize features

## ðŸ’¡ Key Decisions Needed

1. **Language Strategy**: Stick with Bash or migrate to Go?
2. **Scope Priority**: Feature completeness vs. performance?
3. **Target Audience**: Developers first or enterprise?
4. **Release Cadence**: Weekly betas or monthly releases?

## ðŸ“Š Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Bash performance limits | High | Consider hybrid approach early |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Security audit before 1.0 |
| Platform compatibility | Medium | Extensive testing matrix |
| Scope creep | High | Focus on MVP features first |

## ðŸŽ‰ Quick Wins for Momentum

1. **Fix current menu** âœ“
2. **Create demo GIF**
3. **Write blog post**
4. **Submit to Hacker News**
5. **Create Discord/Slack**
